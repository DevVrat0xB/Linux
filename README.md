All the customisation, programs configurations, automation scripts etc to my liking.

## Language Server Installations
| Language Server | Command for Installation |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Emmet| `npm i -g emmet-ls`|
| HTML, CSS, ESLint etc (basic)| `npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted`|
| Angular| `npm i -g @angular/language-server`|
| Go|	`dnf install gopls`|
| Typescript| `npm i -g typescript-language-server`|
| Bash| `npm i -g bash-language-server`|

### Flaws/Shortcomings/ToDo
* [Neovim] Updating NPM would require to re-install all the language server packages installed by earlier version of the NPM.
* [Wayfire] Applications don't have close, minimize and maximize buttons panel.
* [Tmux] No scrolling with mouse.
* [Kitty] Margins around the application.
* [Waybar] Inconvenient Date-Time format.
* [Wayfire] No workspaces.
* [Waybar] Sound control plugin not configured with MUTE functionality.
* [Neovim] Don't have any plugin to preview Markdowns.
